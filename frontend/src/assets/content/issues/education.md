## Education & American Exceptionalism
From the cracking of the atom, to the space race, and pioneering supercomputing, America has been the hub of humanities innovation and progress for decades. We had the best schools and universities in the world, and the greatest minds came to add their abilities to the United States. It brought wealth to the nation, made new opportunities for the next generation, and provided more security then any army.

Sadly, the current administrations egregious cuts to the Department of Education and attacks against our Universities threaten to undermine American exceptionalism at its very foundation. In the words of James Madison, founding father and 4th president, <strong>"The advancement and diffusion of knowledge is the only guardian of true liberty".</strong>

And let me be clear, The Department of Education is not "indoctrinating your children". The DOE funds the schools in our communities, makes sure that the lights can stay on and our teachers have the training they need. It does not set curriculum. Funding for public schools IS NOT controversial, and should not be subject to the whims of partisan politics. The current Administration is currently blocking over six billion dollars from reaching our public schools across the nation. School choice is fine for those who can afford it, but for the 49.6 million Americans across the nation depending on public school, using their access to education and a way to better their life as leverage is sick. Hands off our kids futures.

## Proposed policies and solutions

### 1. Funding For Our Schools
#### Discussion
From day one I will join with the congressmen, attorney generals, educators, and parents across the nation demanding the release of the funding that Congress already approved to support our schools. Investing in our schools is an investment in the next generation, and I will advocate for expanding federal support for educators across the board to keep classrooms open and staffed.

#### Impact on MT-02 Residents
Montana has the highest percentage of rural education in the nation with over 96% of schools classified as small rural schools, over 90 of which have a single teacher as of 2017. Cuts to public education funding disproportionately hurt these communities and may lead to the shuttering of smaller schools that remote communities depend on. Releasing and expanding federal support ensures every Montana child has the resources they need to learn close to home.

### 2. Pre-K Education
#### Discussion
I will be actively supporting the creation of a nationwide program to subsidize the cost of pre-k education. Not only does this greatly lower the cost to working class families that depend on these programs while they work, but numerous studies have shown the advantage that access to good pre-k programs have for children, from supporting their transition into school, higher literacy and better graduation rates. If we truly care about our kids, this is a necessary investment in our future.

#### Impact on MT-02 Residents
Early childhood programs are scarce across rural Montana, forcing parents to choose between keeping their jobs or providing reliable care. Subsidized pre-k gives MT-02 families the support they need to stay in the workforce, stabilizes local childcare providers, and helps young students arrive to kindergarten with stronger literacy and social skills.

### 3. Defending Freedom Of Education
#### Discussion
Among the most fundamental freedoms, each and every American should have the freedom to pursue whatever path to higher education they choose. Big Government has no place deciding what can and cannot be taught on college campuses. These forums for higher education should be free to act without censorship, and students should feel safe to explore whatever avenue of academics they choose. I firmly believe that access to education is a right deserved by every American, and I will actively work throughout my term to explore all options to create new low cost or free ways for Americans to access fundamentally important education.

#### Impact on MT-02 Residents
Safeguarding academic freedom protects Montana's universities, tribal colleges, and trade schools from partisan interference, ensuring our students can pursue the programs that fit their futures. Expanding pathways to affordable credentials opens the door for MT-02 residents of every age to retrain for in-demand careers without the crushing debt that drives talent away from our rural communities.
