## Housing Affordability
In the days of our parents and grandparents, the dream of owning a home was one that almost every American could realistically reach for, pulling themselves up and staking their claim in the great American experiment. Sadly that is no longer the case, and there are generations who face the reality of never being able to own their own home, due to rising costs, low wages, and corporate overreach. This is a travesty that leaves the next generation feeling that the American dream is a fantasy that can never be realized. However, I believe that through immediate and rigorous action from Congress on behalf of the American people, practical investment into affordable housing is a must. By expanding the grant & loan programs for manufactures of sustainable housing, passing new incentive programs for the creation of low and moderate income neighborhoods, and tightening restrictions on investment companies looking to buy out residential construction, we can combat the housing crisis, and ensure opportunities for the next generation.

## Proposed policies and solutions

### 1. Limiting Corporate Real Estate
#### Discussion
Support or propose a bill to limit or restrict corporate land developers or investment firms from acquiring large scale real estate parcels. Housing should be for families first, not a speculative asset class for Wall Street, and Congress must put guardrails in place before investors price working people out of their hometowns.

#### Impact on MT-02 Residents
Restricting corporate land grabs directly addresses the growing concern that Montana land is becoming unaffordable for the very people who live and work here. By preserving access to parcels for local buyers we protect the opportunity for MT-02 residents to purchase a home, keep wealth in our communities, and maintain the character of our towns and rural neighborhoods.

### 2. Investing In Low Cost Construction
#### Discussion
Support or propose a second bill to invest in programs to increase access to energy and resource conservative home construction, such as prefab or tiny homes. Federal incentives can unlock new manufacturing partnerships and keep the next generation from being locked out of housing entirely.

#### Impact on MT-02 Residents
Increasing access to low cost, energy efficient housing options gives Montana residents new pathways to homeownership. Prefab and tiny homes cost far less to build and power, letting MT-02 families stretch every dollar, settle on rural land, and build sustainable homesteads without taking on crushing debt. Every federal dollar invested in these programs goes further and helps more neighbors put down roots.
