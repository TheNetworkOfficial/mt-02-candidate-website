## Housing Affordability
In the days of our parents and grandparents, the dream of owning a home was one that almost every American could realistically reach for, pulling themselves up and staking their claim in the great American experiment. Sadly that is no longer the case, and there are generations who face the reality of never being able to own their own home, due to rising costs, low wages, and corporate overreach. This is a travesty that leaves the next generation feeling that the American dream is a fantasy that can never be realized. However, I believe that through immediate and rigorous action from Congress on behalf of the American people, this can be fixed.

In addition to the rigorous actions I propose in other areas to reinvigorate the economy and lower the cost of living on the working class, practical investment into affordable housing is a must. By expanding the grant & loan programs for manufactures of sustainable housing, passing new incentive programs for the creation of low and moderate income neighborhoods, and tightening restrictions on investment companies looking to buy out residential construction, we can combat the housing crisis, and ensure opportunities for the next generation.


## Proposed policies or solutions:
Support or propose a bill to limit or restrict corporate land developers or investment firms from acquiring large scale real estate parcels. 

Support or propose a second bill to invest in programs to increase access to energy and resource conservative home construction, such as prefab or tiny homes.


## How these policies directly benefit MT-02 residents:
By submitting a bill to restrict or limit corporate land developers and investors from buying up large tracts of land, we can effectively combat the rising sentiment in Montana that land is becoming too expensive for locals to realistically afford, protecting the opportunities for Montana residents to pursue the dream of homeownership.

As a second bill, increasing access to cheap, energy conservative housing options would give Montana residents increased opportunities to become homeowners, with the manufacture cost of tiny / prefab houses being significantly cheaper than traditional housing, and allowing MT-02 locals that wish to homestead in Montanaâ€™s rural areas the opportunity to both acquire land and build a humble home, without excessive financial drain. This would also help to stretch the value that the US government puts into these assistance and loan programs, minimizing the financial cost of each American helped
