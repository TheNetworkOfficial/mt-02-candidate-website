## Housing Affordability
In the days of our parents and grandparents, the dream of owning a home was one that almost every American could realistically reach for, staking their claim in America. Sadly that is no longer the case, and there are generations who now face the looming threat of never being able to own their own home, due to rising costs, low wages, and corporate overreach. This is a travesty, and one that leaves the next generation feeling that the American dream is a fantasy that can never be realized. However, I believe that through immediate and rigorous action from Congress on behalf of the American people, this can be fixed.

Above all, <strong>we need to stop the corporate buyout of America.</strong>
