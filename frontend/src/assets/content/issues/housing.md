## Housing Affordability

**Your stance:** In the days of our parents and grandparents, the dream of owning a home was one that almost every American could realistically reach for, staking their claim in America. Sadly that is no longer the case, and there are generations who now face the looming threat of never being able to own their own home, due to rising costs and inflation, low wages, and corporate overreach. This is a travesty, and one that leaves the next generation feeling that the American dream is a fantasy that can never be realized. However, I believe that through immediate and rigorous action from Congress on behalf of the American people, this can be fixed.


**Proposed policies or solutions:**
Support or propose a bill to limit or restrict corporate land developers or investment firms from acquiring large scale real estate parcels. 

Support or propose a second bill to invest in programs to increase access to energy and resource conservative home construction, such as prefab or tiny homes.


**How these policies directly benefit MT-02 residents:**
By submitting a bill to restrict or limit corporate land developers and investors from buying up large tracts of land, we can effectively combat the rising sentiment in Montana that land is becoming too expensive for locals to realaistically afford, protecting the opportunities for Montana residents to pursue the dream of homeownership.

As a second bill, increasing access to cheap, energy conservative housing options would give Montana residents increased opportunities to become homeowners, with the manufacture cost of tiny / prefab houses being significantly cheaper than traditional housing, and allowing MT-02 locals that wish to homestead in Montanaâ€™s rural areas the opportunity to both acquire land and build a humble home, without excessive financial drain. This would also help to stretch the value that the US government puts into these assistance and loan programs, minimizing the financial cost of each American helped
