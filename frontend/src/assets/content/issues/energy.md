## Energy Production & Environmental Stewardship

**Your stance:** Continued strides towards energy independence are incredibly important, but should not come at the cost of future generations, or this beautiful land of ours. I firmly believe that there is a middle ground that can be found, supporting environmental stewardship, without disenfranchising the many citizens who rely on coal and oil for their livelihoods.

It would be among my greatest honors to help usher in an era of sustainable energy independence that would enrich the lives of citizens, secure our independence on the global stage, and bring new jobs, healthier environments, and prosperity to America.


**Proposed policies or solutions:**
On Day 1 I would propose an Energy transition bill. The Bill would focus on creating a sustainable transition to green energy, focused on offsetting the burden to rural communities. 

It would do this by creating an energy transition fund to be used in the following ways:

Providing tax credits for companies creating new, long term green energy infrastructure jobs in communities built around fossil fuel production. This would include jobs in green energy component manufacturing, maintenance, installation, ectâ€¦

Offsetting the cost of early retirement for fossil fuel employees within 5 years of retirement, to offset the burden of learning a new career shortly before retirement, while ensuring the pensions of long serving Americans as the industry transitions.

Offering federally funded education of employees under the retirement age to prepare them with top education and certification in the green energy sector. 

Paying for a 5 year wage and benefit guarantees package, ensuring that during the transitional period, no worker formally employed in the fossil fuel sector would see a notable gap in their wage or benefits package. Transitional employees waiting to onboard to the newly created career opportunities would be employed in site restoration of now defunct fossil fuel processing sites.

Under this bill, there would a no one left behind provision, ensuring that every American currently employed through the fossil fuel sector would be guaranteed education and employment opportunities in the new green energy sector, allaying the fears of working class Americans who see the closure of coal and fossil fuel mines and plants as a direct detriment to the livelihoods of themselves, their famiilies, and their communities. The total Energy transition bill will call for the creation of 1.4 million new jobs in the clean energy sector over a 10 year period, not only ensuring that each and every one of the ~938,000 Americans currently employed in the oil and coal sectors would have a job, but expanding American energy independence and creating a wave of new, high paying jobs to support the next generation.
 
By aggressively growing the green energy sector, relocating coal and oil subsidies as those industries are phased out, and promoting new, high paying jobs in the new sector for Americans, not only can new jobs be created, environments protected, and a future secured for our children, but it can actually be a net positive to the United States, generating over 173.5 billion in net profit over 10 years, saving tax payers even more money, and reducing the deficit.


**How these policies directly benefit MT-02 residents:**
MT-02 would be among the first to see the benefits of the proposed bill, with its heavy reliance on the fossil fuel sector in places like Coalstrip. By creating localized green energy jobs in the area, residents would not see any undo hardship from the transition away from coal, especially given the already pending closure of the coalstip power plant in a few years. In fact, there would be a net value increase for MT-02, which would see over a 50% increase high paying in energy sector jobs.
