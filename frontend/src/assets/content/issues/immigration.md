## Immigration, Border Security & Crime
It is imperative that the American way of life is protected. And while that means taking a hardline stance against crime in all its many forms, it also means being the beacon of liberty and independence that made this the greatest nation in the world. I support a secure and safe border, but not at the cost of lawful immigration services. 

To that end, I believe that the fastest, cheapest, and most American way to protect our nation's interests is to heavily invest in and overhaul the immigration process, allowing lawful immigrants, asylum seekers, and work visa applicants to fast track their induction into the US, reducing the number of desperate and disenfranchised migrants that may be forced to attempt unlawful entry to the United States, and freeing border patrol to handle actual criminals, rather than detaining poor and desperate families seeking a better life.

We talk a lot about government inefficiency, fraud, and wasteful spending, but I would argue that giving immigration enforcement and border security<strong>$170 billion</strong>, a bigger budget then many countries have for their entire armed forces, while simultaneously cutting off Medicare for 10.4 million Americans, not illegal aliens or migrants, but AMERICAN born citizens, is a prime example of waste, fraud, and inefficiency. I don't know about anyone else, but I have yet to see the "migrant invasion" that requires us to have masked, unmarked secret police be deployed onto American streets. What we need is not a paramilitary, but a more effective and efficient way to distinguish the criminal from the hard working, law abiding immigrant, who believes in building on American dream, as has been the tradition for generations.

## Proposed policies and solutions

### 1. Realistic Immigration Reform
#### Discussion
I will propose a bill that investigates, identifies, and funds the offices required to fast track immigration for lawful immigrants, asylum seekers, and work visa applicants. Additionally, we should increase the penalty for new border infractions to disqualify immigrants who cross the border illegally from applying for the new fast track process while still giving those who play by the rules a fair shot. To ensure applicants are properly integrated as useful and productive members of society, the plan increases a probationary period with work and tax requirements, with citizenship revocation as a penalty for failure to comply. Additional incentives would be added for probationary citizens that are actively working in an industry or field identified as understaffed. Finally, I would propose or support a second bill funding anti-drug and gang border patrol units who are exclusively tasked with combating the fentanyl epidemic and gang activity.

#### Impact on MT-02 Residents
By creating a way to fast track immigration services for lawful immigrants, asylum seekers, and work visa applicants, we significantly reduce government inefficiency, increase tax dollars contributing to American communities, and free up border patrol to more effectively combat gang and drug activity at the border. Rural farming communities like those of MT-02 have struggled to find adequate labor for ranch and farm work, and offering incentivized programs to migrants in those fields reduces the burden on our farmers while keeping our food supply strong. With more workers contributing, we generate the revenue needed to keep Medicare running for the 10.4 million Americans currently being cut off.

### 2. Rural Law Enforcement & Social Services
#### Discussion
I will create a two part bill that funds police and mental health services in rural areas, which are often the target of drug related crime. Law enforcement cannot be asked to shoulder the responsibility alone, so any public safety investment must be paired with resources that help people avoid addiction in the first place and reclaim their lives when they fall.

#### Impact on MT-02 Residents
Using the increased revenue generated by a smarter immigration system, specialized units of border patrol can be freed from processing families and dedicate their efforts to stopping the fentanyl epidemic. A bill designed to fund in equal parts law enforcement, social services, and mental health resources allows MT-02 to combat crime and addiction from every angleâ€”keeping our streets safe, offering those struggling the help they need, and giving those in recovery a real path back to being productive members of society.
