## Immigration, Border Security & Crime
It is imperative that the American way of life is protected. And while that means taking a hardline stance against crime in all its many forms, it also means being the beacon of liberty and independence that made this the greatest nation in the world. I support a secure and safe border, but not at the cost of lawful immigration services. 

To that end, I believe that the fastest, cheapest, and most American way to protect our nation's interests is to heavily invest in and overhaul the immigration process, allowing lawful immigrants, asylum seekers, and work visa applicants to fast track their induction into the US, reducing the number of desperate and / or disenfranchised migrants that may be forced to attempt unlawful entry to the United States, and freeing border patrol to handle actual criminals, rather than detaining poor and desperate families seeking a better life.

We talk a lot about government inefficiency, fraud, and wasteful spending, but I would argue that giving immigration enforcement and border security<strong>$170 billion</strong>, a bigger budget then many countries have for their entire armed forces, while simultaneously cutting off Medicare for 10.4 million Americans, not illegal aliens or migrants, but AMERICAN born citizens, is a prime example of waste, fraud, and inefficiency. I don't know about anyone else, but I have yet to see the "migrant invasion" that requires us to have masked, unmarked secret police be deployed onto American streets. What we need is not a paramilitary, but a more effective and efficient way to distinguish the criminal from the hard working, law abiding immigrant, who believes in building on American dream, as has been the tradition for generations.


**Proposed policies or solutions:**
Propose a bill that would investigate, identify, and fund the required offices & platforms to fast track immigration for lawful immigrants, asylum seekers, and work visa applicants. 

Additionally, increase the penalty for new border infractions to disqualify immigrants who cross the border illegally from applying for the new fast track immigration process.
To ensure these applicants are properly integrated as useful and productive members of society, increase a probationary period with work and tax requirements to their application, with citizenship revocation as a penalty for failure to comply. 

Additional incentives could be added for probationary citizens that are actively working in an industry or field identified as understaffed.
Propose or support a second bill, funding anti drug and gang border patrol units who are exclusively tasked with combating the fentanyl epidemic and gang activity.

Create a two part bill that would fund police and mental health services in rural areas, which are often the target of drug related crime. 


**How these policies directly benefit MT-02 residents:**
By creating a way to fast track immigration services for lawful immigrants, asylum seekers, and work visa applicants, it will <strong>significantly reduce government inefficiency, increase tax dollars contributing to American communities, and free up border patrol to more effectively combat gang and drug activity at the border</strong>. Additionally, by increasing the scope of work requirements for application, it ensures that integrated citizens are not a drain on American social services, and are in fact contributing to the highest degree.

This could be especially beneficial to rural farming communities like those of MT-02 that have struggled to find adequate labor for ranch and farm work. By offering incentivized programs to migrants in those fields, we can reduce the burden on our farmers.

Using the increased revenue that would be generated by having lawful immigrants fast tracked into the tax paying workforce, specialized units of border patrol would be freed up from handling illegal migrant crossings, which would decrease as more lawful options are opened by the fast track application, and would be able to dedicate their efforts to stopping the fentanyl epidemic, with no additional burden on US taxpayers.

A bill designed to fund in equal parts law enforcement, social and mental health services would effectively be able to combat crime and drug addiction from three angles, keeping our streets safe, and offering those struggling with addiction the help they need, and offering those in recovery an option to rejoin society as a productive citizen.
