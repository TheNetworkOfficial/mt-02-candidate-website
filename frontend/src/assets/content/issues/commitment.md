## My Commitment To America

<strong>"Politics are corrupt"</strong>

<strong>"It doesn't matter who you vote for, they're all crooks."</strong>

<strong>"They don't care about you if your not one of them"</strong>

These and more are the things I grew up hearing about our elected officials. And more then that it's what I saw. Politicians who are supposed to represent us ignoring the needs of the many for the benefit of the few, giving out meaningless, hollow condolences every time the American people suffer another tragedy, disaster, or disenfrancisment, saying there is <strong>"nothing they can do"</strong>, and then turning around and having the audacity to hold their hand out and ask for our hard earned dollars, promising that if we give and reelect them again, then <strong>"this time they will be able to change things for the better"</strong>.

But it never gets better. Because once they get more of our time, our money, and our vote, they forget about us all over again, toadying to the lobbiests, special interest groups, and out of touch billionares, selling us out after WE elected them so they can line their own pockets.

We saw an example of this callous disreguard right here in Montana back in March, when Sentator Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, as well as Representitive Troy Downing did not even bother showing up to their own town halls when we came out to question them on the actions in D.C.

------------------------------------------


It was John Adams, founding father and second president of these United States who said "May none but Honest and Wise Men ever rule under This Roof". These words are carved into the mantle of the state dining room as a reminder of the political duty to continuity and good governance. Yet I cannot think of a single politician currently representing our nation who genuinely upholds this value.

That is why I am running. I am not a politician. I am not a statesman or a lawyer groomed to obey the ologarchy.

I'm a farrier. I work on horses for ranchers and cowboys trying to make a living here in Montana. Before that I was a large animal vet tech, and before that I was the son of a poor single mother. I have never wanted to be a politician, and quite frankly I still don't. But I also realize that someone has to do something, or it will never get any better. It is for that reason that I am running. In the time honored tradition of our founding fathers, I want to represent my fellow Americans, not as their "better", living apart from them, but as a one of the working class, who knows working class struggles.

It is past time we start electing politicians who remember that they are <strong>public servants</strong>, beholding to the American people.

So here are my commitments to you:

1. As your representitve I will strive to actually represent you. And that starts by listening to you. I will never be beyond the reach of my consistuents. That means before I propose or pass legislation, I welcome input. It also means that if I host a town hall, I am actually going to show up. Even if you want to yell at me, as your representitive, it is not just my job, but my duty to hear you out.

2. I will never be bought. Superpacs, special intrest groups, and party politics are corrupting, evil influences that cause nothing but misery and suffering, and I will have no part in them. During my term in office, I will strive to be the most transparent politician in history, and will gladly live my life under a microscope so that there is no question that I answer soley to the American people.

3. Woulda, shoulda, coulda, why not now? We always hear how our rep would do something good, if only...(insert lame excuse here), and sometimes it might even be true, for the big ticket items. But I say why wait? From day one of this campaign we are going to try to make a positive impact on the lives of the American people. So rather then big tv ads about how bad the other guy is, I want to let y'all decide that for yourselves, and I'll take that money and put it towards funding our afterschool programs, helping our veterans, and cleaning up our communuties. And that inititive won't end come election day. In the 118th congress, the House was in session for 117 days. That leaves 248 days a year unaccounted for, and I don't know any working class Amercian that can get away with only working 117 days a year.

As your representitive, I will advocate for each and every one of you. No matter your race, religion, or creed, no matter if we are the best of friends or don't see eye to eye on a single issue, I will spend every waking moment of every day in office working for the working classâ€”because I am working class
