## Economic Stability & Cost of Living
Economic instability and the rising cost of living are among the most vital issues facing Montana & our nation as a whole, especially in rural communities, where access to essentials may be scarce or only available at higher costs. 

The United States has long been the wealthiest nation on earth, and yet the vast majority of Americans are a single unexpected expense away from financial disaster. In the last 10 years alone, the purchase power of the dollar has dropped by 26.5%, the cost of living has increased by 35.9%, and the federal minimum wage hasn't risen a dime from $7.25 an hour. All the while corporations and the ultra wealthy continue to benefit from year over year record profits, increased tax breaks, and subsidized operating costs.

I am sure that I am not the only one that has ignored a medical emergency, determined to "walk it off", rather then face putting my family into years of medical debt we will not recover from. 

<strong>This isn't just unconscionable, it is unacceptable.</strong>

The American dream we were promised isn't a supposed to be a dystopia. We are not just cogs in the corporate machine, to be cast aside and replaced when we drown under the weight of societies inequalities. There is absolutely no reason that the working class should be living paycheck to paycheck so that our tax dollars can subsidize some billionaires private plane.

To me, it's a pretty cut and dry issue. Our current administration preach on the idea of fiscal responsibility, while passing the largest tax cuts on the wealthy in American history, and passing on the increased bill to us at a tune of 466 billion dollars in additional debt each year. convenient I suppose, when the median net worth of our congressional representatives is over 1.2 million dollars.

<strong>I will make sure the wealthy pay their fair share</strong>, starting with a flat 2% wealth tax on individuals with a net worth over 100 million, reducing capital gains tax cuts for the highest net worth investors, and pulling subsidies from multi-billion dollar companies already making massive, untaxed profits.

With these changes alone, we can reverse the course of financial irresponsibility that has become the hallmark of politics. We can embetter the lives of Americans, with government provided childcare, medical leave, and an increased minimum wage adjusted for inflation, all without rasing taxes on the working class by a single cent. And before you claim that taxing the wealthy or providing government backed services is a "woke communist agenda", I would remind you that Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, received 6.3 billion in subsidies last year alone, while already earning more then double the income of every single Montanan combined! That is a government handout. <strong>That is socializing the undeserving. That is taxation of the many, with representation for only the few.</strong>
