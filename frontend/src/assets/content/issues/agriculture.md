## Agriculture and Rural Livelihoods
Agriculture has and will continue to be the backbone of Montana, and the farmers & ranchers of our nation must be supported. As a farrier and large animal vet tech before that, I have seen and supported the struggles of working class ranchers most of my life, and I am fully in support of measures that reduce the burden on our farmers & ranchers, increase their fiscal opportunities, and safeguard them from unexpected costs.

## Proposed policies and solutions

### 1. Cutting Inheritance Tax
#### Discussion
Although already in congress for voting, I would continue to support measures that reduce or remove inheritance tax on estates. Should the current bill fail due to its wide reach, I would make it a priority to reintroduce a more specific version of the bill for those with land dependent rural livelihoods.

#### Impact on MT-02 Residents
Should a new version of inheritance tax bill be required, I will submit an amendment that makes a special exemption for estates used specifically for rural livelihoods that are dependent on land access, such as farms and ranches, making them totally exempt from death and estate taxes, provided that the land continue to be used for the purpose of rural livelihood support over the course of a ten year period following the inheritance. Although less impactful then the current version of the bill before congress, should that bill fail, this more specific version may be able to pass, protecting the farmers and ranchers of MT-02 without losing out on revenue from other, wealthier sectors.

### 2. Tariff Control
#### Discussion
Of critical importance is creating sustainable and long lasting fiscal opportunities that support our farmers. Tariffs and international animosity put our rural communities on the frontline of trade wars, which is a burden they cannot support. It would be among my first priorities to author or support legislation to push congress to revoke the delegation of tariffs from the seat of the president, and return the full powers of the purse to Congress, as originally intended by the Constitution. As part of this, or as a secondary bill, I would propose the immediate renegotiation of tariffs with all foreign nations, prioritizing those that act as the largest international trade partners of resources vital to America's agricultural sector.

#### Impact on MT-02 Residents
The trade war and reciprocal tariffs have already heavily impacted the rural communities of MT-02, with essential costs soaring, international profits from selling Montana wheat plummeting, and representation unresponsive to constituent concerns. Not only does this add stress and uncertainty for our agricultural sector, but even imposes a greater, hidden cost, in the form of the increased debt, loss of tax based subsidies, and lower incomes. Reducing or removing the out of control tariffs can only benefit MT-02, allowing our farmers lower costs on everything from fencing to essential services.

### 3. Farm Subsidies and SNAP
#### Discussion
Concurrent with expanding and protecting our farmers access to foreign markets, it is also important that we continue to develop domestic support as well. Extending or marking parts of the Farm Bill perpetual, preserving access to SNAP, and reducing the cost of crop insurance are imperative steps that I unequivocally support.

#### Impact on MT-02 Residents
In the efforts to cut costs by a fraction of their initial promise, DOGE and the current administration urged cuts to SNAP, Medicare, and other essential services our agricultural communities depend on. The "Big Beautiful Bill" finalized these cuts, with 44,742 Montanans projected to lose access to Medicare, an additional 21,500 to lose SNAP by 2034, while ignoring the benefit those programs provide to the hardest working Americans. Studies by the USDA's Economic Research Service prove that further support of these programs boosts income for the agriculture industry and supports the creation of new agricultural sector jobs. I am not saying that there is no room for reform and cost cutting in these programs, and if the constituents of MT-02 want reform of these programs I will support it, but it is a fact beyond consideration that these programs are vital to help MT-02 succeed, and I will fiercely advocate for their restoration.
