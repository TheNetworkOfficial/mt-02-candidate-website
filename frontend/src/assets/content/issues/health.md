## Health Care and Social Services

**Your stance:** Unequivocally, I believe in greater access to affordable health care and social services. It is a travisty that so many in our country are one medical emergancy away from total financial ruin. Pharmaceuticals and insurance providers rob the American people on a daily basis, holding their very lives hostage to line the pockets of their shareholders. It is beyond criminal, and my greatest shame as an American citizen that we allow it. On this, my mind will never be changed.


**Proposed policies or solutions:**
I would without reservation support any legislation calling for lowered prices of life saving medications and preventative care. 

This would include supporting or authoring legislation to investigate the exorbitant pricing of lifesaving drugs, hospital stays, and preventitive care. When exhobanant costs unsupported by manufacturing costs and reasonable profits are uncovered, I would rabidly advocate for, and if necessary author legislation myself to sanction the offending company, hospital, or pharmaceutical company, finding any and all way to punish them for their extortion of the American people.

As stated in some of my above legislation, I would campaign heavily on not only protecting, but actively expanding access to Medicare, Medicaid, and veteran health care services. Critics state that these programs are “wasteful” and “costly”. I say so what? The government exists to SERVE the American people. To expect the people of our nation to contribute, through their labors, service, and taxes, just to turn around in their hours of need and deny them access to lifesaving treatments is an unacceptable betrayal of the peoples trust.

If my consituents wish for it, I would support reform of the system to ensure that funding is not being misused, but under absolutely no circumstances will I support defunding or sunsetting these programs.

As mentioned above in my Economic Stability & Cost of Living section, I would actively advocate for the expansion of rural townships and communities. Part of this would be allocation of new rural health care and municiple services, paid for in part by the revenue generated by these expanding communities.


**How these policies directly benefit MT-02 residents:**
While not directed exclusively at the residents of MT-02, by combating the rising cost of health care, and taking an agressive stance against areas of the health care industry that seek to actively undermine the American people, MT-02 would see direct benefit in the form of lower drug prices and health care costs, which would be a net benefit for every citizen.

Additionally, as a counter to critics and budget hawks, by making the residents of MT-02, or any district in the nation, healthier, it extends the working life of citizens, reduces drain on social services and disability, and increases the median lifespan and quality of life. That is an investment in the American people, and the American people are worth investing in.

Although a net gain for the nation as a whole, an increase in Medicare, Medicaid, and veteran care services disproportionately and directly impacts MT-02. Socially funded health care like Medicare are key in maintaining the health of our farming and rural communities. Likewise, MT-02 has a high population of veterans, and those who have best served our country deserve access to quality health care without having to fight through endless bureaucratic red tape.

In MT-02, there are vast health care “deserts”, where there is no access to medical services of any kind for long stretches. This is detrimental, especially for those working in rural livelihoods, which are often hard and dangerous.

By actively supporting the expansion of rural townships and funding the creation of clinics in those towns, we can close the gaps, both in preventative health care, which is often ignored due both to its cost, and to its long distance from these communities, and to access to emergency services that could save a life in the case of a medical emergancy.
