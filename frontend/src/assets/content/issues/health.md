## Healthcare and Social Services
Healthcare is not a luxury service, it is a fundamental human right, and no one deserves to be left to die if they cannot afford the extortionist system that is United States healthcare.
The fact that over 15 million Americans have medical debt affecting their credit, punishing them for the need to survive, is unacceptable.

Pharmaceutical companies, corporate hospitals, and insurance providers rob the American people on a daily basis, holding their very lives hostage to line the pockets of their shareholders. It is beyond criminal, and my greatest shame as an American citizen that we allow it. On this, my mind will never be changed.

Luckily, there is an easy solution to all of this. Single payer, universal healthcare, accessible to all American citizens, with an opt out. And before you ask where the money for it would come from, I would say that a good place to start would be pulling the <strong>2+ trillion</strong> in federal subsidies we are already paying insurance companies already each year, since at least to me, paying a company to rob me is a little crazy.


**Proposed policies or solutions:**
As stated above, I firmly believe that a single payer universal health care system is a fundamental change needed in the United States, and I would make it a priority to support such legislation, so long as it can deliver the following:

* <strong>Full Coverage Healthcare:</strong> deductibles, network providers, & corporate oversight of what qualifies as "necessary care". All of these artificial constraints create unnecessary barriers to accessing medical treatment, and drive up the price you pay for service. At the end of the day, your healthcare should be between you, and your doctor, and absolutely no one else. Preventative healthcare in particular should not be gatekept by what policy you can afford, and it has been definitively proven time and again that greater access to prophylactic care reduces emergency room visits, medical debt, and disability rates. Under a full coverage, single payer healthcare system, you will pay significantly less out of pocket, while getting access to higher quality healthcare.

* <strong>Drug Price Negotiation:</strong> Unless you own stock in Eli Lilly, I can't imagine you are happy paying $275 for Insulin, an essential medication that costs $3.37 to produce (Thats an 8060% tax on staying alive). Under a unified, single payer system, we would have the leverage to bring drug manufacturing companies to the table and bring drug prices down to a reasonable cost. I'm not saying we can't have free market, but I am saying that I will not accept a world where anyone has to decide between a prescription they need to live, and paying their rent.

* <strong>Rural Healthcare Expansion:</strong> Rural America's healthcare infrastructure is sorely lacking, with vast healthcare “deserts” that lack access to medical services of any kind. This is detrimental, especially for those working in rural livelihoods, which are often hard and dangerous, I should know, I wrote this section with a puncture wound in my hand from working on a horse more then an hour from the nearest town. By actively supporting the expansion of rural townships and funding the creation of clinics in those towns, we can close the gaps, both in preventative healthcare, which is often ignored due both to its cost, and to its long distance from these communities, and to access to emergency services that will save lives.

* <strong>Out Out Program:</strong> Despite my strong beliefs that a single payer healthcare system is the best opportunity to give every American access to the healthcare they deserve, it cannot come at the cost of personal freedoms. In this, the ACA was wrong, and I would only support a single payer system that explicitly guarantees the right of every citizen to opt out of the program with no fine, should they wish to seek private insurance instead.

The reformation of the American healthcare system is extremely important, but it is not a task that will happen overnight, and in the meantime, the programs we have must be preserved. From day one in office, I will not only advocate for, but actively work to expand access to Medicare, Medicaid, and veteran healthcare services. Critics say that these programs are “wasteful” and “costly”. I say so what? The government exists to SERVE the American people. To expect the people of our nation to contribute, through their labors, service, and taxes, just to turn around in their hours of need and deny them access to lifesaving treatments is an unacceptable betrayal of the peoples trust.

Additionally, I would support, or author legislation to investigate the exorbitant prices of lifesaving drugs, hospital stays, and preventative care. When exorbitant costs unsupported by manufacturing costs and reasonable profits are uncovered, I would rabidly advocate for, and if necessary author legislation myself to sanction the offending company, hospital, or pharmaceutical company, finding any and all way to punish them for their extortion of the American people.

**How these policies directly benefit MT-02 residents:**
While not directed exclusively at the residents of MT-02, by combating the rising cost of healthcare, and taking an aggressive stance against areas of the healthcare industry that seek to actively undermine the American people, MT-02 would see direct benefit in the form of lower drug prices and healthcare costs, which would be a net benefit for every citizen.

Additionally, as a counter to critics and budget hawks, by making the residents of MT-02, or any district in the nation, healthier, it extends the working life of citizens, reduces drain on social services and disability, and increases the median lifespan and quality of life. That is an investment in the American people, and the American people are worth investing in.

Although a net gain for the nation as a whole, an increase in Medicare, Medicaid, and veteran care services disproportionately and directly impacts MT-02. Socially funded healthcare like Medicare are key in maintaining the health of our farming and rural communities. Likewise, MT-02 has one of the highest populations of veterans in the nation, and if you have served our country, then you deserve access to quality healthcare without qualification.
