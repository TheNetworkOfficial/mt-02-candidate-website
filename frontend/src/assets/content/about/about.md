**My name is Sam Lux**, and I'm running for Congress in Montana’s second congressional district because America deserves representatives who genuinely serve the interests of the people—not career politicians who seek power for personal gain. I am 29 years old, live in Great Falls, Montana, and I am farrier by trade, serving ranchers, farmers, and horsemen / horsewomen across our great state.

Let me be clear: I don’t want to be a politician. Politicians, in my view, have too often proven to be corrupt, self-serving, and detached from the realities faced by everyday Americans. My decision to run is driven solely by a sense of duty to my community, state, and country. I believe deeply that public office should be about service, not career advancement or personal enrichment.

## **Why I'm Running:**
America, Montana, and particularly its rural communities, face significant challenges—from economic instability and soaring living costs to threats to homeownership and agricultural livelihoods. As someone who built his life and livelihood here, hustling Doordash and Instacart to support my family while building my business, I understand these challenges intimately. I am committed to actively addressing the issues that face every American through common-sense solutions and pragmatic legislation that genuinely benefits Montanans.

##
**Defending American Values:** I grew up believing America is the land of the free and home of the brave—a place where everyone, regardless of race, religion, or creed, could achieve the American dream. Yet today, that dream is undermined by politicians loyal only to party lines, billionaires, and Super PACs. As your representative in MT-02, I will relentlessly advocate for every individual's rights and fiercely oppose threats to our nation's freedoms. To the “moneymen” of politics: I am not, and never will be, for sale. My only accountability is to the people of Montana's second district.

##
I am running because I owe a service to my fellow Montanans and to America as a whole. It's time that the working class was represented by the working class.
