About Sam Lux

My name is Sam Lux, and I'm running for Congress in Montana’s second congressional district because America deserves representatives who genuinely serve the interests of the people—not career politicians who seek power for personal gain. At 29 years old, living in Great Falls, Montana, I’m a farrier by trade and a small business owner deeply familiar with the struggles and joys of life in our state.

Let me be clear: I don’t want to be a politician. Politicians, in my view, have too often proven to be corrupt, self-serving, and detached from the realities faced by everyday Americans. My decision to run is driven solely by a sense of duty to my community, state, and country. I believe deeply that public office should be about service, not career advancement or personal enrichment.

Why I'm Running:
Montana, particularly its rural communities, faces significant challenges—from economic instability and soaring living costs to threats to homeownership and agricultural livelihoods. As someone who has built his life and livelihood here, I understand these challenges intimately. I am committed to actively addressing these issues through common-sense solutions and pragmatic legislation that genuinely benefits Montanans.

Key Issues and Priorities:
Economic Stability and Cost of Living: Our rural communities need relief from rising costs due to inflation and restrictive tariffs. I support legislation to strengthen trade connections, helping Montana farmers gain fair access to global markets. Additionally, I am dedicated to investing in small businesses, particularly in underserved communities, to stimulate local economies, create jobs, and lower living costs for everyone.

Affordable Housing: Homeownership was once attainable for every American but is increasingly becoming out of reach. I will fight against corporate real estate consolidation, advocate for legislation restricting large corporate land acquisitions, and champion programs that provide affordable, energy-efficient housing options for all Montanans.

Immigration and Border Security: A secure nation respects its laws and its values. I support reforming and streamlining the immigration process to quickly and efficiently welcome lawful immigrants, asylum seekers, and workers while ensuring border patrol resources focus on genuine threats such as drugs and violent crime. This approach benefits our community, enhances safety, and boosts local economies through increased, lawful workforce participation.

Agriculture and Rural Livelihoods: Having spent my career as a farrier and large animal vet tech, I understand firsthand the critical importance of agriculture in Montana. I will prioritize policies that protect farmers from unnecessary taxation, provide stable access to international markets, and ensure robust domestic support through programs like SNAP and affordable crop insurance. Farmers deserve stability and opportunities, not tariffs and uncertainty.

Energy Production and Environmental Stewardship: Montana deserves energy independence that doesn't sacrifice our environment or the livelihoods dependent on traditional energy sectors. I propose a sustainable energy transition plan that guarantees new job opportunities, education, and financial security for workers transitioning from fossil fuels to green energy, ensuring no community is left behind.

Health Care and Social Services: It's unacceptable that Americans face financial ruin due to medical emergencies. I will fiercely advocate for legislation to reduce healthcare and pharmaceutical costs, expand access to Medicare, Medicaid, and veterans' healthcare, and invest in rural healthcare infrastructure. Healthy communities are prosperous communities.

Defending American Values: I grew up believing America is the land of the free and home of the brave—a place where everyone, regardless of race, religion, or creed, could achieve the American dream. Yet today, that dream is undermined by politicians loyal only to party lines, billionaires, and Super PACs. As your representative in MT-02, I will relentlessly advocate for every individual's rights and fiercely oppose threats to our nation's freedoms. To the “moneymen” of politics: I am not, and never will be, for sale. My only accountability is to the people of Montana's second district.

I am running because I owe a service to my fellow Montanans and to America as a whole. Together, we can reclaim government as a force for good, ensuring it works for everyone—not just the privileged few. It’s time for genuine representation in Congress.
