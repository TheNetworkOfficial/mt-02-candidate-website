            <h2>Economic Stability &amp; Cost of Living</h2>
            <p>
              <stonger>My Stance: Economic stability and cost of living control are among the most vital issues facing Montana, especially in rural communities, where access to essentials may be scarce or only available at higher costs. For the future success of Montana communities, we must safeguard our communities from increased costs due to tariffs and inflation, especially in regards to exports by Montana farmers. We must also protect access to affordable housing, by limiting corporate real estate consolidation, and funding programs to provide affordable housing.</stonger>
            </p>
            <p>
              Proposed policies or solutions:
              Support legislation that strengthens connections with top importers of Montana created commodities by reducing trade impediments (such as tariffs).
            </p>
            <p>
              Heavily support small business development and funding bills, with the direct focus on developing underserved communities with essential services.
              How these policies directly benefit MT-02 residents:
              By building relations with top imports of Montana goods and reducing trade impediments, Montana farmers would benefit from increased trade opportunities to sell their products. America should offer free market opportunities to its farmers, allowing them maximum opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              By increasing access to small business development loans for underserved communities, subsidies, and grant programs, Montana's rural communities will benefit in several ways.
            </p>
            <p>
              Townships and cities will experience construction of new infrastructure, as new business owners join the workforce to develop essential service industries, necessary for the expansion of those communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Local construction and skilled professional services will see increased revenue from contracts to build the new infrastructure, supporting the tradesmen of America.
            </p>
            <p>
              Local and County level governments will see increased activity in their districts, benefiting from taxes and fees collected by the new facilities
              Individuals living in the affected communities will see the greatest benefits of all, as increased access too, and competition with, other local services and facilities drive prices down in rural communities traditionally limited by the cost of importing resources.
