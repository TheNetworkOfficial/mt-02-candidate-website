            <h1>Coalition for Montana's Future</h1>
            <p>
              The only way that we defend our democratic values is by standing together,
              with a unified voice on the issues that matter most to Montana. That is why,
              as part of my campaign, Lux For Montana is proud to launch the Coalition for Montana's Future.
              This coalition brings together local patriots running for office across the state,
              from city council to Congress, who share our vision for a better Montana.
            </p>
            <p>
              Together, we will go to our councils, state house, and Congress not just with promises,
              but with a plan to deliver real results for our communities, and support in every level of government.

          <p>
            The Coalition for Montana's Future is a grassroots alliance of candidates
            and community leaders from across the state, committed to building a brighter future for the people.
            
            It was inspired by the need for to present a united front and the desire to campaign on actionable causes and not just empty promises.
            
            By working together, we can amplify our voices, increase awareness of fellow candidates that share our morals, and support
            each other in the fight for positive change. The coalition is built on the same principles that founded this great nation, 
            that we, as fellow-citizens, should unite with one heart and one mind to restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without 
            which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things.
          </p>
          <p>
            As members of the Coalition for Montana's Future, we pledge to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Work towards the common good of all peoples in Montana, and America as a whole.</li>
            <li>Raise the awareness of like minded candidates, for we are more with our brothers and sisters then we are alone.</li>
            <li>Engage with our communities to understand their needs and priorities.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            What the Coalition for Montana's Future will never do:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Expect compromise. The goal of this plan is to identify areas where our existing morals overlap, so we might promote 
              our commonalities, not argue our differences.</li>
            <li>Require compensation from candidates. The Coalition for Montana's Future is a grassroots tool to increase awareness of candidates 
              based solely on their platforms, not the depth of their pockets.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The political climate in Montana and across the country is more divisive than ever, and it is clear that we cannot achieve our goals alone.
            By joining the Coalition for Montana's Future, we can build a stronger, more united movement that puts the people above the political posturing,
            and prove to unsure voters that we are not only able to win, but united enough to make real change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note From Sam Lux: "I conceptualized the Coalition for Montana's Future after speaking with everyday Montanans who expressed frustration
            with the current Democratic Party and its inability to effectively challenge the entrenched Republican establishment.
            Many felt that the party was out of touch with their needs and concerns, and that it was not doing enough to support local candidates who shared their values.
            I believe that by coming together as a coalition, we can amplify our voices and create a more inclusive and representative political movement.

            I believe this so strongly that I am committing my own campaign to building this coalition and promoting my fellow candidates, without expectation
            of anyone else to do the same. If you are a candidate who shares my commitment to putting Montana and its people first, or you know of such a candidate,
            please reach out and I will donate the software needed to integrate the coalition into your own campaign website or application."
