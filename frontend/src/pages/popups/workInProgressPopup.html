    <h2>A Work In Progress</h2>
    <p>Excuse the mess! The campaign is just beginning, and I am currently working on it alone.</p>
    <p>Not all portions of the site are complete at this time, and I encourage you to check back in as we expand, or join our newsletter to get notified when it is complete. 
      No spammy fundraising messages I promise.</p>
    <p><em>It's a grass roots campaign, and we all have to start somewhere.</em></p>
