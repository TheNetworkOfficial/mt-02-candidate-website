        The Coalition for Montana's Future is a grassroots alliance of candidates and community leaders from across the state,
        committed to building a brighter future for the people.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was inspired by the need to present a united front and the desire to campaign on actionable causes—not just empty promises.
        By working together, we can amplify our voices, increase awareness of fellow candidates who share our morals, and support each other in the fight for positive change.
        The coalition is built on the same principles that founded this great nation: that we, as fellow citizens, must unite with one heart and one mind to restore
        harmony and affection to our civic life.
      </p>
      <h3>We Commit To</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Working toward the common good of all peoples in Montana, and America as a whole.</li>
        <li>Raising awareness of like-minded candidates—because we are stronger together than we are alone.</li>
        <li>Engaging with our communities to understand their needs and priorities.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>We Will Never</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Expect compromise on core values. The goal of this coalition is to identify where our morals overlap so we can promote our commonalities—not argue our differences.
        </li>
        <li>
          Require payment to participate. The Coalition for Montana's Future is a grassroots tool to increase awareness of candidates based on their platforms,
          not the depth of their pockets.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The political climate in Montana and across the country is more divisive than ever, and it is clear that we cannot achieve our goals alone.
        By joining the coalition, we can build a stronger, more united movement that puts people above posturing and proves to unsure voters that we can win—and govern—together.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="coalition-popup__quote">
        <p>
          "I conceptualized the Coalition for Montana's Future after speaking with everyday Montanans who expressed frustration with the current Democratic Party
          and its inability to effectively challenge the entrenched Republican establishment. Many felt the party was out of touch with their needs and was not doing enough
          to support local candidates who shared their values. I believe that by coming together as a coalition, we can amplify our voices and create a more inclusive and
          representative political movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe this so strongly that I am committing my own campaign to building this coalition and promoting my fellow candidates—without expectation that anyone else
          must do the same. If you are a candidate who shares my commitment to putting Montana and its people first, or you know of such a candidate, please reach out and I will
          donate the software needed to integrate the coalition into your own campaign website or application."
